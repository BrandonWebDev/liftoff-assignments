## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Kansas City Businesses (KCB) is designed to shine a spotlight on local
minority-owned businesses in the Kansas City area. The web app provides a
directory of these businesses, where business owners can register their business
on the website, along with information about what they offer or makes them stand
out, hours of operation, and contat information. Users will find this app useful
as it makes it easy to discover new, diverse businesses they can support.
Additionally, it allows users to search by category, such as restaurants,
clothing stores, or hair salons. The idea for the app came from a desire to
promote diversity and support local businesses in Kansas city.

### Features

  enabling them to save their favorite businesses and leave reviews.
- **Search:** Allows users to search for businesses by name, category, or
  location, making it easy to find the businesses they're looking for.
- **Create Business**: Allows business owners to register their business on the
  app, providing information about their products or services, hours of
  operation, and contact information.
- **Like Business:** Allows users to "like" businesses, allowing them to save
  the business as a favorite and view it later.
- **Mobile Responsive:** The app will be designed to be mobile responsive,
  allowing users to easily access and navigate the app from their smartphones or
  tablets.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll have to learn authentication and authorization using Spring Security and
JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This will involve learning how to secure the user login
feature, and how to generate, sign, and verify JSON web tokens to authenticate
users. I'll also have to learn how to use Spring Security to implement
role-based access control, so that only authorized users can perform certain
actions in the app. This is important for ensuring the security of the app and
protecting the user's data.
